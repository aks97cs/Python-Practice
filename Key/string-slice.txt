Attempting to use an index that is too large will result in an error:

>>>
>>> word[42]  # the word only has 6 characters
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
IndexError: string index out of range
However, out of range slice indexes are handled gracefully when used for slicing:

>>>
>>> word[4:42]
'on'
>>> word[42:]
''
