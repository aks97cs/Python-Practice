Python is an interpreted high-level programming language for general-purpose programming. 
Created by Guido van Rossum and first released in 1991, Python has a design philosophy that emphasizes
 code readability, notably using significant whitespace. It provides constructs that enable clear
  programming on both small and large scales.[27] In July 2018, Van Rossum stepped down as the leader
   in the language community after 30 years.[28][29]

Python features a dynamic type system and automatic memory management. It supports multiple 
programming paradigms, including object-oriented, imperative, functional and procedural, 
and has a large and comprehensive standard library.[30]
